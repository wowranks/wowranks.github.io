<p style="max-width:400px;">Due to problems with getting data from <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/wow-api-limits-and-429-errors/18526" target="_blank">the API</a> wowranks.io website is no longer active. All private data (bnet login info) will be deleted in the next few days. If you want to ask me anything, I will always be available on <a href="https://discord.gg/2NyH332" target="_blank">discord</a>.

I will keep the background processes running privately with a low chance (really really really low) of getting the website public again. If you want to get some statistics, message me and I'll see what I can do. It's a bummer I can't keep it running publicly in this situation, because a lot of data is outdated and does not represent reality.
